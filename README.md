# About Me
I am a Research Scientists in Artificial Intelligence working on Natural Language Processing at Meta AI with an interest on how to make AI safer and more aligned with human values.

I completed my PhD at Facebook AI Research on the subject of text simplification and how to use AI to help people with cognitive disabilities.

I consider myself part of the Effective Altruism (EA) community and Iâ€™m very keen on maximizing my positive impact on the world.
