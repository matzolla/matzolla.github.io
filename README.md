# About Me
I am a Research Engineer enthusiast in Artificial Intelligence working actively on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I'm currently building an AI research group called [WedOO.ai][https://www.linkedin.com/company/wedoo-ai/]

I completed my PhD at Facebook AI Research on the subject of text simplification and how to use AI to help people with cognitive disabilities.

I consider myself part of the Effective Altruism (EA) community and Iâ€™m very keen on maximizing my positive impact on the world.
